# RI5C Risk Index Coefficient
## Python - NetworkX â€“ BigQuery - SigmaJS implementation of an easy to use, simple framework to measure the health of smart contracts in Ethereum using network analysis.

First implementation will use NetworkX: https://github.com/networkx/networkx, Pandas, Maplotlib and Python-Louvain for simple community arranging. **A lot of work is missing, but this can already produce simple network analyses** 

## Motivation
Due to the public nature of transaction data on blockchain based financial systems, it is possible to model these systems as a network and analyze its structure to provide and define whether the different variables that emerge in the transaction history of ERC20 tokens can be used to correlate the health of the system and therefore propose a risk coefficient that quantifies how active the token is, how distributed it is and inferr how likely it is to respond to contagion and how stable the price is.

## Quick start
As is standard everything you need is ```requirements.txt```. 

If it's your first time using vagrant, check out how to use it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/).
```
vagrant up
get server running and start creating stuff
vagrant ssh

$ cd /vagrant/
$ python # To run a console
```

Database created is called "mydb", to load psql console type:
```
psql -d mydb
```

### Configuring BigQuery
Note that this software uses Google's BigQuery Ethereum dataset, based on the fantastic work found of Evgeny Medvedev: https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl.

You should activate a BigQuery account following these instructions: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics

and you should have your access info in ```ri5c/config/big_query_cred.json```

PS: the location of that file is specified in an environment variable called ```GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS```


## Load data and Evaluate
Find an interesting contract: ([OmiseGo](https://omisego.network)) ```omisego = "0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07"```

And now, from Python console run:

```from ri5c.get_contract import network_this```

```network_this(omisego, limit=3000)```

Where *limit* is the transaction limit.

This will save the prepared data as *data.json* on your source folder

## Load data on simple browser

Use bundled minified SigmaJS data or go [their repo](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js) for an updated version, *then run a simple Python server* on your root folder:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

And go to 127.0.0.1:8000 to view the results

### Examples: ie: interesting contracts
